# Project Name

Project - CloneFLIX

> This project represents my second experience with web development, focusing on the front-end. It is intentionally simple and should be considered one of the initial steps in a longer learning journey.

> This website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of my web development studies. It is a simplified model (primary) of an interface inspired by the streaming platform - NETFLIX. This project also marked my first experience embedding a video file (.mp4) on a web page and interacting with a pre-built component provided by the Bootstrap library (site: https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Features

- Optimized for screen sizes up to 750px;
- Toggle video sound on and off with a button;
- Create a modal (menu) accessible through the "More Information" link with a click;
- Allow the modal (menu) to open and close with individual clicks;
- Utilize a ready-made image carousel component in the Bootstrap components library.

## Technologies Used

- Software: Visual Studio Code (for coding);
- HTML5 (website structure);
- CSS3 (website styling);
- JavaScript (user interaction with the site);
- Bootstrap (library of ready-made components, layouts, grids, themes, etc.);
- Git (for local and remote interaction via command line);
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (for free website hosting).

## Notes

The project walkthrough only covered the initial steps (code creation and uploading the project to a site). 
The creation and organization of files like `reset.css` and `responsivo.css,` the use of `<span>` elements, other visual 
modifications, folder structuring, and uploading and publishing of the project on GitHub Pages were implemented independently 
based on the knowledge and skills acquired so far.

This project includes a 2-minute and 7-second video clip for educational and learning purposes only. 
The audiovisual content belongs to Netflix and was used solely for study purposes related to web development and interface design. 
There is no commercial intent or redistribution of this content.
